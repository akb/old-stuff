rebop: next-generation web framework for node.js

rebop is an attempt to wed the two paradigms of a standalone web server (e.g. 
Apache) and a web programming framework (e.g. Django, Rails). rebop will 
consist of a middleware stack for Connect, a handful of command-line utilities,
and a web-based management interface.

the heart of rebop is an in-memory data structure called a resource tree that
contains information about how each resource available should behave. this
tree is constructed when the web server is loaded and remains in memory until
the server is shut down, though it may be modified while it runs.
