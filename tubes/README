Tubes is a node.js web server framework in the form of a DSL. It is NOT
intended for production use. I just wrote this to explore HTTP framework
design.

Tubes is inspired by jQuery, Django, and Rails, but also the late senator Ted
Stevens. Tubes upholds Mr. Stevens' famous words by having the programmer
define a web server as a series of tubes.

A simple server that serves static files can be defined by:

tubes('/').connect().toDirectory('./static/');

Doing things manually is easy as well:

tubes('/form').connect()
  .get.toTemplate('formtemplate.html')
  .post.to(function (request, response, complete) {
    this.formData(function (data) {
      new MyModel(data).save(function () {
        complete('Created');
      });
    });
  })
})

settings:
	server.response.defaultMIMEType
	server.response.defaultTextEncoding
