Lex's Playground
================

All of this code used to be stored in separate github repositories but it's all
code that I didn't want people to think they should actually use. Some of it is
perfectly usable code, but I didn't want to 'go public' with it due to lacking
unit tests, documentation, etc. Some folders have additional documentation,
most do not. Use any of this code at your own risk, however you may do so if
you really want.
